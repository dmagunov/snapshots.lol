# NFT ERC-721 Smart Contract

This repository contains a basic implementation of an NFT ERC-721 Smart Contract using the Hardhat framework.

**Please note** that this implementation is for testing purposes only and does not support the collaborative aspect. The real implementation should support collaboration, allowing multiple users to contribute to the creation of an NFT and receive a portion of the funds if the NFT is sold. See [Issue #4](https://github.com/user/repo/issues/19) for more info.
