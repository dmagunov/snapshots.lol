## About The Project

<!-- <video> -->

Collaboration has the power to create unique projects! Just take a look at Reddit Place - a project where people from all over the world came together to create a massive collaborative artwork. I want to take this idea even further and create a new kind of art that brings together all sorts of different elements like images, videos, and texts.
